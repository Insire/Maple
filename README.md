This is a rewrite of the original InsireBot. Which was planned to be a tool for semi and non professional livestreamers to provide music to them selfs and to their audience with high configureability.

After a long hiatus, I'm continuing my rewrite and try to improve on my previously written code. You can see a "live" preview [here](https://github.com/Insire/Maple/blob/master/InsireBot/Resources/Images/2017-04-22-23-26-20.gif). I also often refer to this project when explaining concepts to colleagues at work or during discussions in the [C# Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VCFhEDy).
